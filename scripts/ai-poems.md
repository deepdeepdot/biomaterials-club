Write a poem on disgusting icecream flavors for a shop
---

Rancid meat and slimy cheese
A concoction that will make you wheeze
Chunks of moldy bread and dirt
A treat that will make your stomach hurt

Putrid fish and stinky socks
A flavor that will make you gag and mock
A mix of plastic and old glue
It's a flavor you don't want to chew

A blend of week-old spoiled milk
A flavor that will make you feel like you're made of silk
A dollop of tar and used motor oil
A taste that's unlike any other, it can't be spoiled

A swirl of old banana peels
It's a treat that no one ever feels
Worms and maggots with a dash of dirt
A flavor that will make you want to squirt

Write a poem on the future of biomaterials solving plastics and pollution
---

We live in a world of plastics and pollution,
A world of destruction, of land and of ocean,
Where our air and water is filled with debris,
And the future of our planet is unclear to me.

But biomaterials offer a new solution,
A future of hope for us all to live in,
A future of clean air, water, and land,
A future we can all understand.

Biomaterials offer a new way,
A way to reduce our plastic waste,
A way to restore the Earthâ€™s balance and peace,
A way to create a future that will never cease.

Biomaterials are made from renewable sources,
From plants and animals and more,
They require less energy to create and use,
And can help us reduce our global emissions too.

No longer will our planet suffer
From the effects of plastic pollution,
Biomaterials will help us create a better world,
A world of clean air and water and land,
A world of hope and new possibilities.
